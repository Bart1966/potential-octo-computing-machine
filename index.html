<h1>Structuring Word Documents</h1>

<p>The use of headings and subheadings in any document
often reflects a hierarchy of information.<br/> For example, a
document might start with a large heading, followed by
an introduction or the most important information.</p>

<h2>Subheadings</h2>
<p>This might be expanded upon under subheadings lower down
on the page. <br/>When using a word processor to create a document,
we separate out the text to give it structure. </p>

<h3>Sections</h3>
Each topic might have a new paragraph, and each section can have a heading to describe what it covers.<br/>

<h4>Writing</h4>
We use structure in the same way when writing web pages.<br/>
To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.</div>
